This a Flutter widget to display stories just like Whatsapp and Instagram. Can also be used
inline/inside ListView or Column just like Google News app. Comes with gestures
to pause, forward and go to previous page.

# Installation

To use this plugin, add `story_view` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

# Usage

Import the package into your code 

```dart
import "package:story_view/story_view.dart";
```

Look inside `examples/example.dart` on how to use this library. You can copy
and paste the code into your `main.dart` and run to have a quick look.

## Basics
Use [`StoryView`](https://pub.dev/documentation/story_view/latest/story_view/StoryView-class.html) to add stories to screen or view heirarchy. `StoryView` requires a list of [`StoryItem`](https://pub.dev/documentation/story_view/latest/story_view/StoryItem-class.html), each of which describes the view to be displayed on each story page, duration and so forth. This gives you the freedom to customize each page of the story.

There are shorthands provided to create common pages. 

`StoryItem.text` is a shorthand to create a story page that displays only text.

`StoryItem.pageImage` creates a story item to display images with a caption.

`StoryItem.inlineImage` creates a story item that is intended to be displayed in a linear view hierarchy like `List`
or `Column`

```dart
@override
Widget build(context) {
  List<StoryItem> storyItems = [
    StoryItem.text(...),
    StoryItem.pageImage(...),
    StoryItem.pageImage(...),
  ]; // your list of stories

  return StoryView(
    storyItems,
    repeat: true, // should the stories be slid forever
    onStoryShow: (s) {notifyServer(s)}
  )
}
```
